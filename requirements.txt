# requirements for ZeroDCE/main.py
# NOTE: PyTorch packages (torch, torchvision) often require selecting a wheel
# that matches your CUDA drivers. If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want CUDA
# acceleration, follow instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# and install torch/torchvision separately before or instead of the lines below.

# Example CPU-only PyTorch (you can uncomment and run the command below instead)
# pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
